to install orichalcum in a venv, get poetry and run:

orichalcum is released under the MIT license, so feel free to use it however you want, but i highly recommend against using it at all. for anything.
it's built for one specific focus, and is very fine tuned for that, there are definitely way better youtube data api scrapers out there. it really only
exists here for archival/transparency purposes. also, it isn't made that well, i had to implement a bunch of unique hacks because of anthony's inconsistencies
in naming and labeling.
